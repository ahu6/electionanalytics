## Welcome!

Hello! My name is Alison Hu, and I'm a sophomore at Harvard University studying Applied Math and Economics. I am deeply interested in data science and data journalism, and this blog will explore those areas in the context of the United States presidential election system. As part of my coursework for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, my goal is to analyze possible predictors for the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election and to convey my insights in a clear and engaging way. I hope you'll join me along this journey!

If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to email me at [ahu@college.harvard.edu](ahu@college.harvard.edu).
