## Welcome!

Hello! My name is Alison Hu, and I'm a sophomore at Harvard University studying Applied Math and Economics. I am deeply interested in data science and data journalism, and this blog will explore those areas in the context of the United States presidential election system. As part of my coursework for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, my goal is to analyze possible predictors for the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election and to convey my insights in a clear and engaging way. I hope you'll join me along this journey!

If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to email me at [ahu@college.harvard.edu](ahu@college.harvard.edu).

As we witnessed during the 2016 presidental election season, predicting a presidential election’s outcome is difficult. Scholars have put forth numerous theories, with many factors that may help to determine who will win, yet there is always room for surprises and uncertainty. To set the scene for our prediction model, we begin by exploring the system we have in place for selecting our country’s president — the electoral college system — and its consequences. Next week we will begin building our predictive model.

This week we begin building our predictive model using economic indicators. Voters often use past results to make inferences about the future, and measures surrounding the state of the economy are some of the most easily obtained, and thus most used, features to make these judgments. However, voters focus on the near past, not the entire four-year term of the sitting president. For instance, if unemployment rates are high at the beginning of a president's term but low in the time period leading up to an election, voters may still view him favorably and be more likely to vote for the incumbent party in the next election. This has implications both on how we should set up our model but also on how candidates choose to portray themselves during campaign season.
