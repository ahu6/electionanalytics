# Election Narratives
### December 10, 2020

As more information and analyses emerge surrounding this year's election, the media and campaigns are speculating on some possible narratives to explain why the election turned out the way it did. In our final blog post, we test a narrative supporting Biden's win, claiming that the Biden campaign's message was effective in both mobilizing and persuading voters. To do so, we look at ad messages, campaign speeches, and Twitter data.

### The Media Narrative

> "President-elect Biden ran as a moderate looking to bring decency back to the White House and to unite the country. Go watch Biden’s campaign launch speech, squint, and watch his first speech as President-elect. One brand, well-positioned! Despite the crazy, Twitter-driven news cycle and the global pandemic, the campaign maintained that message and tone.”

### Ad Messaging


### Twitter Analysis
We can test the consistency of Biden's campaign message by looking to Twitter, an increasingly influential medium in which voters may be mobilized or persuaded.
