# Economic Indicators
### September 21, 2020

This week we begin building our predictive model using economic indicators. Voters often use past results to make inferences about the future, and measures surrounding the state of the economy are some of the most easily obtained, and thus most used, features to make these judgments. However, voters focus on the near past, not the entire four-year term of the sitting president. For instance, if unemployment rates are high at the beginning of a president's term but low in the time period leading up to an election, voters may still view him favorably and be more likely to vote for the incumbent party in the next election. This has implications both on how we should set up our model but also on how candidates choose to portray themselves during campaign season.

### Economic Retrospection: A Coin Toss

In their book _Democracy for Realists_, [Achen and Bartels](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q) conclude that during presidential elections, voters essentially "toss a coin" to select a winner. This statement follows from the theory of **economic retrospection**, the tendency for voters to reward or punish the incumbent president's party based on their perceptions of how the economy and their personal welfare are doing. This can be a positive sign that voters are making rational decisions grounded in evidence. However, as [Healy and Lenz](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24363467) show, voters may be misled due to the nature of human thinking and heuristics; in fact, only the six months leading up to the election are what really affects voters' decisions, not the entire span of the presidency.

#### Economic Voting Model: National

Given the above findings, we construct our model using data collected in quarters two and three of election years. The goal of our model is to predict the incumbent party's two-party popular vote share.

First, we test the predictive power of the growth rate of GDP (gross domestic product) in the second quarter of election years.

According to [Achen and Bartel](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q), RDI (real disposable income) is a better predictor than GDP (150), so we test this next.

We try a multivariate regression next. ... (colinearity) However, the size of the confidence interval increased, so it does not appear that including more than one variable improves our model.

Why do we see such large discrepancies between the different models? For, 2020 has been far from a normal year; with COVID-19, the economy has now seen things (insert link) that it has never before. With GDP growth rates so low, it is clear that the model that we have built, using data from 1948 to 2016 in which an economic shock as large as the one we are experiencing now did not occur, may be not an accurate predictor of our current economic climate.

#### Economic Voting Model: Local

Perhaps economic indicators are better at a localized level. We test this out by creating a new model for each state.
