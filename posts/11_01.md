# Final Prediction
### November 1, 2020

Using everything we have learned and explored these past seven weeks, we present our final prediction for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

### Model

To predict the election outcome, we use a **weighted ensemble** of **linear regression models**, fitted to the following sets of data:
* Polling data from election years 1948 to 2020, by state
* COVID-19 deaths, from February 27 to October 27, by state
* Demographic data 1990 to 2018, by state

For each state, we run three different linear regression models as follows:
![Model Equations](../figures/model_eq.png)
where
* Incumbent Vote = incumbent party 2-party vote share
* Average Poll Support = average support from polls in a given state and a given year (1972–2016)
* COVID-19 Deaths = total deaths due to COVID-19 in a given state up to a given date (02/27/20 to 10/27/20)
* Black Change = change in black population between consecutive election years (1976–2016) in a given state
* Female Change = change in female population between consecutive election years (1976–2016) in a given state

We then construct the ensemble with the following weights:
