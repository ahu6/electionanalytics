# Incumbency
### October 5, 2020

The influence of incumbency in election outcomes is a widely studied factor in political science. This week, we look at how adding an incumbency indicator variable affects our predictions, as well as whether the incumbency advantange applies to this year's presidential election.

### The Time-for-Change Model

A 
The time-for-change model uses three variables to generate predictions:
* GDP growth rate in 2nd quarter of election year
* Incumbent party's net approval rating
* Indicator variable for whether an incumbent president is running

(Explanation...)

We use the Gallup poll results with end dates in the month of October so that approval ratings represented are the most relevant leading up to the election. Based on the data available, there are eleven years included in our model: 1952, 1960, 1968, 1984, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016.

To predict, we use the latest Gallup poll ratings available for 2020, which come from July. The below figure shows the results from the time-for-change model and the variant using RDI instead of GDP.

**The time-for-change model using GDP growth rate predicts Trump to win 37.0% of the two-party popular vote**, whereas **the time-for-change model using RDI growth rate predicts Trump to win 70.1%**. However, both predictions generate wide margins of error, with the lower and upper bounds of the GDP model and RDI model being 11.4% and 62.7%, and 38.2% and 102.0%, respectively.

Compared to our models from Week 2: Economic Indicators, which only included GDP and/or RDI, these models show improvement in that the predictions yield more realistic results (closer to 50%) with slightly smaller confidence intervals. In other words, including polling data and the incumbent indicator variable may improve predictive power.

### Trump and Incumbency

Incumbents usually face a number of structural advantages, including the following. We consider each of them for Trump in the context of the 2020 election:
* **Increased media attention**:
* **Head start on campaigning**:
* **Access to larger funding**:
