# Shocks: COVID-19
### October 26, 2020

Can shocks, defined as any unexpected or unpredictable events, influence an election's outcome? This question has been studied by scholars in many different contexts, including shark attacks ([Achen and Bartels 2017](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvc7770q)), war causalties ([Karol and Miguel 2007](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/33/_Paper__Electoral_Cost_of_War.pdf)), and sports game results ([Healy et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.abstract)). Though the causal effects of shocks are difficult to isolate, we return to the theory of retroactive voting, noting that voters do tend to eithe reward or punish incumbents based on events in their term. Thus it is plausible that shocks, even ones seemingly apolitical, can alter some voters' behaviors. We explore shocks that may affect the 2020 presidential election, including the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and social movements of magnitude and reach unique to this year.

### A Look Into COVID-19 Polling Data

Although the occurrence of natural disasters is outside of the president's control, the president can control his response to the natural disaster, of which [Healy et al. 2010](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.abstract) found can have substantial effects on election outcomes. Their findings may be applicable to the current climate of COVID-19, and as a recent [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/upshot/polling-trump-virus-election.html) in *The New York Times* has found, as deaths due to COVID-19 go up in a given area, their support for Trump goes down. 

Using [polling data](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/supporting-public-opinion-data-related-covid-19?utm_source=Data+Dive+from+Roper%40Cornell+6.28.18&utm_campaign=28df841335-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_10_08_04_38_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b24149c0c3-28df841335-&utm_source=Data+Dive+from+Roper%40Cornell+6.28.18&utm_campaign=28df841335-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_10_08_04_38_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b24149c0c3-28df841335-580634065) regarding the pandemic collected September 11–12, 2020, we can look at where public opinion stands.

### Predicting Voter Turnout

Despite the far-reaching and dramatic effects that COVID-19 has had on society, the effects of even this shock on influencing voters' views of the presidential candidates may be relatively low due to political polarization and the strength of partisanship in our present political climate. What may have an influence on the election outcome, however, is the effects of COVID-19 on **voter registration and turnout**. 

Let’s model the potential fluctuation in turnout due to COVID. In Week 3, we used a linear regression model fitted to each state to predict voter support for the incumbent party based on polling numbers. However, as we saw, doing so sometimes led to predicted vote shares below 0 or above 100 — impossible outcomes. A solution to account for the natural boundaries of vote share is to use a binomial logistic regression model instead. This model takes into account the size of the **voting-eligible population (VEP)** and models each voter as either voting or not voting for the candidate.

Here are the three datasets we are joining:
* Popular vote share by county for election years from 2000 to 2016
* COVID death counts February 1, 2020, to October 17, 2020, per the [CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-in-the-United-St/kn79-hsxy)
* Demographic data by county from 1990 to 2018
We can match state and FIPS codes to join the data together.


Another possible shock for this year’s election is the increased mobilization, or surges, of certain demographic groups due to the unprecedented levels of civil unrest. We can model the potential effects of these surges.
